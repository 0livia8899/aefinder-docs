## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```yarn``` install all modules

The `yarn start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

```yarn build```
